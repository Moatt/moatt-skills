## In 30 seconds

```bash
npx moattai login
npx moattai install champion-departure-trigger
```

Then in Claude Code / Cursor / Codex:

> *"Did any of our past champions change jobs recently?"*

The skill scans LinkedIn and the web for role changes among past buyers, qualifies the new accounts against your ICP, and drafts a warm re-intro from you — both a retention nudge for the old account and a fresh expansion play for the new one.

One install. One question. No vendor dashboards, no per-tool keys.

## The four levels

Skills compose in four levels. Each one wraps the level below — pick the right level for the job you're trying to do.

### Moves (148)

Atomic skills. One skill, one job: find an email, scrape a page, run a search, pull brand assets.

> `email-finder-hunter` — finds emails for a domain via Hunter.io
> `geo-audit` — scores your site's AI-search citation readiness
> `linkedin-scraper` — pulls profiles, company pages, posts

Reach for a move when you know the exact data you need.

### Plays (64)

Orchestrated workflows. A play chains multiple moves into one end-to-end job — input → processing → output.

> `champion-departure-trigger` — detects when past customer champions take new jobs, then fires retention + warm-expansion outreach
> `ad-angle-miner` — mines ad copy angles from reviews, Reddit, support tickets, and competitor ads
> `battlecard-generator` — builds sales battlecards from competitor website, reviews, ads, and pricing

Reach for a play when you want a recurring growth job done in one ask.

### Moats (5)

Durable systems run on a schedule. Moats take longer to set up, then keep producing for months. They're your AI agent's permanent job.

> `outbound-prospecting-engine` — full outbound system: signal detection → research → contact finding → personalization → launch
> `competitor-monitoring-system` — daily competitive intel across web, social, and news with delta reports

Reach for a moat when you want a pipeline that keeps running without you.

### Kits (2)

Curated bundles. A kit ships several skills that go together for a specific motion — one install, the whole toolkit.

> `lead-gen-devtools` (6 skills) — discovery orchestrator, GitHub repo signals, community signals, competitor signals, event signals, personalized demo builder
> `video-production` (5 skills) — beat-synced reels, AI-animated product reels, talking-head videos, long-form to short-form clipping, screen-rec polish

Reach for a kit when you're starting a new motion and want everything at once.

## Install

```bash
# One-off (recommended for first try)
npx moattai login
npx moattai install <slug>

# Or install globally so you can type `moatt` directly
npm install -g moattai
moatt login
moatt install <slug>
```

After install, ask your AI coding agent to do something a skill covers — it picks the right skill and runs it.

> Commands below use `moatt` (global install) — prefix with `npx moattai` if you didn't install globally.

### Install flags

```bash
moatt install <slug> --claude              # Force a single target
moatt install <slug> --cursor --project-dir .
moatt install <slug> --force               # Convert legacy installs to symlinks
```

### Find and refresh

```bash
moatt search "<query>"                     # JSON output (agent-friendly)
moatt search "<query>" --human --limit 5   # Human-readable list
moatt list                                 # Full catalog
moatt info <slug>                          # Details for one skill or kit
moatt update                               # Refresh every installed skill
moatt update <slug>                        # Refresh one
```

---

## Where skills go on disk

Skills follow a canonical-store + symlinks layout so one update reaches every agent:

```
~/.agents/skills/<slug>/                   ← canonical files (single source of truth)
~/.claude/skills/<slug>     → symlink ──→ ~/.agents/skills/<slug>
~/.codex/skills/<slug>      → symlink ──→ ~/.agents/skills/<slug>
<project>/.cursor/rules/moatt-<slug>.mdc   ← real file (Cursor's rule format requires inline content)
```

`moatt install` is idempotent — re-running it on an already-installed skill is a no-op. `moatt update` refreshes the canonical copy and every symlink picks up the new content automatically.

---

## How it works

Each skill ships as a self-contained directory: `SKILL.md` (agent-readable instructions), `skill.meta.json` (catalog metadata), and any helper scripts. The CLI fetches these from this repo and lands them in the right place for your agent.

Most skills route API calls through the **Moatt proxy** with usage-based billing. One key (`MOATT_API_KEY`) covers all 24 upstream vendors — no juggling vendor accounts, no separate bills.

<details>
<summary><b>Auth + credentials</b> — CLI commands, credentials file shape, multi-project flow</summary>

```bash
moatt login
```

This opens your browser, signs you in, lets you pick a default project, and writes the issued key to `~/.moatt/credentials.json` (`chmod 0600`). Skills read that file and send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on every proxy call.

### Auth commands

```bash
moatt login              # Browser-based login + project picker
moatt logout             # Clear local credentials (key stays valid on server)
moatt logout --all       # Also revoke the key on the server
moatt whoami             # Email, org, current project
moatt status             # whoami + credit balance + key info
moatt credits            # Print credit balance (JSON; --human for table)
moatt projects list      # List all projects your key can use
moatt switch <slug>      # Change the default project (local, no browser)
```

`moatt switch` is the gh-CLI-style flow: one login mints a single key for your org, then flip between any project you have access to without re-authenticating.

### Credentials file shape

```json
{
  "api_key": "mk_...",
  "api_base": "https://moatt.com",
  "email": "you@example.com",
  "userId": "user_...",
  "clerkOrgId": "org_...",
  "orgName": "Acme",
  "currentProject": "acme-marketing",
  "projects": [
    { "id": "...", "slug": "acme-marketing", "name": "Acme Marketing" },
    { "id": "...", "slug": "acme-seo",       "name": "Acme SEO" }
  ],
  "loggedInAt": "..."
}
```

Keys use snake_case so skills can read them with one-line Python snippets like:

```bash
export MOATT_API_KEY=$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$HOME/.moatt/credentials.json'))['api_key'])")
```

## Skill metadata contract

Every skill ships two required files.

**`SKILL.md`** — Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: >
  One paragraph explaining what the skill does and when an agent
  should reach for it.
tags: [lead-generation, research]
---

(skill body — instructions for the agent, code blocks, examples)
```

**`skill.meta.json`** — registry metadata:

```json
{
  "slug": "my-skill",
  "category": "moves",
  "tags": ["lead-generation", "research"],
  "installation": {
    "base_command": "moatt install my-skill",
    "supports": ["claude", "cursor", "codex"]
  }
}
```

Optional fields override auto-derived registry entries: `name` (display name), `version`, `argumentHint`, `domain`, `appName`, `changelog`. See [`schemas/skill-meta.schema.json`](schemas/skill-meta.schema.json) for the full contract.

---

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moatt/moatt-skills.git
cd moatt-skills
npm install
npm run validate:skills        # Lint every skill against the schema
npm run build:index            # Regenerate skills-index.json + registry.json
```

The catalog builder reads `SKILL.md` frontmatter and `skill.meta.json`, walks any helper files under each skill directory, and emits two JSON files at the repo root.

---

## Contributing

Adding a new skill takes three files: a directory under `skills/<level>/<slug>/`, a `SKILL.md`, and a `skill.meta.json`. Run `npm run validate:skills` to lint, `npm run build:index` to refresh the catalog, then open a PR.
